Okay, I just want to take a moment and write down how I want the flow of the game to go because I'm running in to an issue with trying to code. Basically up to this point I have been designing basic frameworks but now it's time to actually make the spsifics. So here I'm going to put down what I want to happen so that everyone knows why I'm putting things where I am. This is mostly for the leveling and class system for now.

Menu Screen
	Here should go the main menu stuff pretty simple mostly already done
Level Select
	Here is where one selects what dungeon to go in to also has the campfire
	Campfire
		This is where you select which class to go with, also where you take you level ups
		To be clear this means that no leveling will happen in dungeon only exp gains
		The level ups are also spsific to each class
		Will need to store how many level ups a class has and store the stats seperatly
		We will need buttons that allow the player to allocate statsups
		Also perks would go here too
		Those stat ups will take effect once the level up is confired
		In other words we need to update whereever those stats are being stored
		However as gear is only spawned inside the dungeon we only need to update gear stats once a level is selected
		I think this about covers everything most of what this needs is UI work the formulas themselves are easy
Dungeons
	The basics are all here
	The only thing I need to do here is the armour on hit
	Also procdural genreation hopefully I can get that done tonight
	Inventoy is in progress and so is the gear
	For the gear all we need to do is store the players base stats in a seperate value from the stats from gear
	then call an update stats functions which is fine because we need one any way just reusing the same code
	on death certian things need to be recorded such as levels gained and stuff we will dive more in to this as needed
Saves
	I am looking in to xml files for recording persistant data it doesnt look hard we just need to decide what get put there
